# Python Review Homework

* When you accepted the assignment through GitHub Classroom, a hw-py repository was created for you in the stat386-fall2023 organization.  Your homework repsitory is "github.com/stat386-fall2023/hw-py-\<your user name\>.com"
* Do a `git clone` on this repository into a directory on your computer (first navigate to the location where you'd like the repo downloaded)
* Once you've done the `git clone`, a directory called "hw-py-\<your-user-name\>" was created. Please do all your work inside this directory
* You must complete the assignment in Jupyter Notebooks using python.  
* You should include your neat, well-documented code for each answer (in one file)
* While you are working on this assignment, you should occasionally add and commit your work to your *local* git repository.
* If you did the clone correctly (and have worked in the directory that was created from the clone), the remote connection should already be set up to link to your homework repository. You should occasionally push your work to the *remote* repository.  
* To submit your assignment, ensure that your completed python notebook is in your *remote* homework repository before the due date.  


You can find the questions for this assignment in the file called "hw-python-review.ipynb".  Answer the questions directly in the notebook.
